Inventory &amp; Supply Chain Management Dashboard using Power BI

The dashboard highlights 3 key KPIs:
📦 Warehouse Utilization (34.08%) – Shows how much storage is being used and where we can improve.
📅 Days Sales of Inventory (15.56) – Tells us how long products stay in stock before being sold.
🔁 Inventory Turnover Ratio (23.47) – Measures how efficiently inventory is moving.

Along with these, I added supporting visuals to give a fuller picture:
📈 Units Sold Over Time – Tracks how sales have changed year by year.
 🚚 Transportation Costs by Region & Category – Helps pinpoint where logistics are more expensive.
 ⏱️ Lead Time by Product Category – Useful for identifying delays and improving vendor performance.
 🔄 Backorder Status – Highlights the number of fulfilled, pending, and canceled orders.
 🧭 Inventory Levels by Region & Category – Shows how stock is distributed to support better planning.
