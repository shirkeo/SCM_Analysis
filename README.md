# SCM_Analysis
Inventory & Supply Chain Management Dashboard using Power BI, focused on making operations easier to track and optimize with clear, visual insights.

The dashboard highlights 3 key KPIs:

1. 📦 Warehouse Utilization (34.08%) – Shows how much storage is being used and where we can improve.
2. 📅 Days Sales of Inventory (15.56) – Tells us how long products stay in stock before being sold.
3. 🔁 Inventory Turnover Ratio (23.47) – Measures how efficiently inventory is moving.

Along with these, I added supporting visuals to give a fuller picture:
1. 📈 Units Sold Over Time – Tracks how sales have changed year by year.
2. 🚚 Transportation Costs by Region & Category – Helps pinpoint where logistics are more expensive.
3. ⏱️ Lead Time by Product Category – Useful for identifying delays and improving vendor performance.
4. 🔄 Backorder Status – Highlights the number of fulfilled, pending, and canceled orders.
5. 🧭 Inventory Levels by Region & Category – Shows how stock is distributed to support better planning.

✅ Built with:
1. Power BI
2. DAX
3. Interactive filters for Region & Category
